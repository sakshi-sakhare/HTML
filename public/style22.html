            A paragraph is a unit of writing consisting of several sentences that develop a single idea or topic, acting as a structural division in prose to help organize thoughts and make text easier to read. Paragraphs typically begin with a topic sentence that states the main idea, followed by supporting sentences with details or examples, and can end with a concluding sentence that summarizes or bridges to the next paragraph
