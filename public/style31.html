    Kedarnath Temple, located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand,
    India, is one of the holiest Hindu shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva. Perched at an
    altitude of about 3,583 meters in the Garhwal Himalayas near the Mandakini River, the
    temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas and a significant part of the Char Dham Yatra. It is believed
    to have been originally built by the Pandavas and later revived by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century.
    Constructed from massive stone slabs, the temple's unique architecture has withstood centuries of harsh weather
    and natural calamities. Due to heavy snowfall, it remains open only between April/May and November;
    during winter, the deity is moved to Ukhimath for worship. Pilgrims reach Kedarnath either by trekking
    1618 km from Gaurikund or by helicopter services. Rich in mythology and spiritual significance, Kedarnath attracts
    thousands of devotees and adventure seekers every year.
