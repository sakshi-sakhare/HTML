        Kedarnath Temple, located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand,
        India, is one of the holiest Hindu shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva. Perched at an
        altitude of about 3,583 meters in the Garhwal Himalayas near the Mandakini River, the
        temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas and a significant part of the Char Dham Yatra. It is believed
        to have been originally built by the Pandavas and later revived by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century.
